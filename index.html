		The Doors were an American rock band formed in 1965 in Los Angeles,
		 with vocalist Jim Morrison, keyboardist Ray Manzarek, guitarist Robby 
		  and drummer John Densmore.
They are simply the greatest band that ever came out of america,
 when the uk had beatles and stones the americans had the doors

Great Sound! Great Band! Jim Morrison is one of the best vocalist of all time!

The most creative band of a creative era, with a distinctive sound and energy.
 Too bad Jim was hell bent on self-destruction. Still fresh and original 
 today and their romantic 
 'fillers" like "Hyacinth House," "Winter Time Love," etc. are moody gems.
No other band on this list captured an era like The Doors. Most creative,
 intelligent, lyrical band on any American list. And no, not just Jim Morrison,
 but Robbie Krieger, Ray Manzarek, and John Densmore. All equally talented and creative.
  No other band on this list captures the imagination like the Kings of Acid Rock!
  Morrison died in uncertain circumstances in 1971. The band continued as a trio until disbanding in 1973.[10][11] They released three more albums in the 1970s, two of which featured earlier recordings by Morrison, and over the decades reunited on stage in various configurations. In 2002, Manzarek, Krieger and Ian Astbury of the Cult on vocals started performing as the Doors of the 21st Century. Densmore and the Morrison estate successfully sued them over the use of the band's name. After a short time as Riders on the Storm, they settled on the name Manzarekâ€“Krieger and toured until Manzarek's death in 2013.

The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs.[12] According to the RIAA, they have sold 33 million records in the US[13] and over 100 million records worldwide,[14] making them one of the best-selling bands of all time.[15] The Doors have been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time by magazines including Rolling Stone, which ranked them 41st on its list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time".[16] In 1993, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
The Doors began with a meeting between acquaintances Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek, both of whom had attended the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, on Venice Beach in July 1965. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs (Morrison said "I was taking notes at a fantastic rock'n'roll concert going on in my head")[17] and with Manzarek's encouragement sang "Moonlight Drive". The members came from a varied musical background of jazz, rock, blues, and folk idioms.[18]

Keyboardist Manzarek was in a band called Rick & the Ravens with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer John Densmore was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes.[19] In August 1965, Densmore joined the group, which had been renamed the Doors. The five (Morrison having previously joined the band), along with bass player Patty Sullivan[nb 1] recorded a six-song demo on September 2, 1965 at World Pacific Studios, Los Angeles, California (officially made available much later in October 1997 on the Doors' Box Set CD release). This has circulated widely since then as a bootleg recording. The band took their name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception, itself derived from a line in William Blake's The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: "If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite".[20] In mid-1965, after Manzarek's two brothers left, guitarist Robby Krieger joined.[21]
